# AirMouse


### This right here is an application of the latest openCV version ,where I have used its optimal tracing features and using it along with Autopy made an AirMouse ,you can control the mouse through finger gestures. 

### The begining steps were tracing the fingers and perfectly outlining the number of fingers.

### Further using Autopy we integrated the mouse movements and added in the clicking functionality ,when you close the two finger you get a click.

### Further all the changes were made to make this experience as smooth as possible, such that all areas of the screen are accessible.
